#WorldDownloader 1.11a for Minecraft 1.11 using MCP 9.35-rv1

A minecraft mod that downloads a copy of a world on a multiplayer server for personal singleplayer use.  This is a fork of [@dslake's original version](https://github.com/dslake/WorldDownloader), updated to 1.11.

MCP is used for decompilation and recompilation.  Download it from [here](http://www.modcoderpack.com/website/releases).

You can also try [@uyjulian's liteloader version](https://github.com/uyjulian/LiteModWDL/) (which is based off of this one).
